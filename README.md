# Countdown Timer Project

## 🧠 What is this project?
This is a **real-time countdown timer** using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to input a future date and time, then dynamically displays the time remaining until that moment.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Learn how to use **date inputs** and capture user input
- Understand how to **work with Date objects** in JavaScript
- Use **setInterval** and **clearInterval** to manage timers
- Practice DOM updates and conditional rendering based on time

## 🛠 How It Works
- The user enters a date/time using the `datetime-local` input field
- When "Start Countdown" is clicked, the app starts a timer
- The timer updates every second, recalculating and showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds left
- If the countdown ends, the timer stops and displays an alert

## 🧩 Why This Matters
- Handling **real-time updates** is an essential front-end skill
- Working with time and date logic introduces you to real-world JavaScript use cases
- Building a UI that responds to time is great practice for dynamic DOM skills

## ✨ Extension Ideas
- Let the user add a custom message to show when the countdown ends
- Style the timer to match a theme (New Year, Birthday, etc.)
- Add a sound or animation when the countdown finishes

## 🗃 Files Included
- `index.html` – Structure of the timer and input field
- `style.css` – Styling for the timer and layout
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic to calculate and update the countdown

## ✅ What’s Next?
After understanding how this timer works, consider how you could reuse the logic in reminders, alarms, or event countdown apps.

Time is ticking ⏳ — happy coding!
